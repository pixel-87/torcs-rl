1 Introduction

This manual describes the competition software for the Simulated Car Racing Championship, an
international competition held at major conferences in the ﬁeld of Evolutionary Computation and
in the ﬁeld of Computational Intelligence and Games.

The goal of the competition is to design a controller for a racing car that will compete on a set
of unknown tracks ﬁrst alone (against the clock) and then against other drivers. The controllers
perceive the racing environment through a number of sensors that describe the relevant features
of the car surroundings (e.g., the track limits, the position of near-by obstacles), of the car state
(the fuel level, the engine RPMs, the current gear, etc.), and the current game state (lap time,
number of lap, etc.). The controller can perform the typical driving actions (clutch, changing gear,
accelerate, break, steering the wheel, etc.). A description of the championship, including the rules
and regulations, can be found at http://cig.sourceforge.net/

The championship platform is built on top of The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS) a
state-of-the-art open source car racing simulator which provides a full 3D visualization, a sophisti-
cated physics engine, and accurate car dynamics taking into account traction, aerodynamics, fuel
consumption, etc.

In the remainder of this manual, we provide an overview of the architecture, the instructions
to install the software and to run the simple drivers provided in the package, the description of the
sensors and the actuators.

2 The Architecture of the Competition Software

The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS) comes as a stand-alone application in which the bots
are compiled as separate modules that are loaded into main memory when a race takes place.
This structure has three major drawbacks. First, races are not in real-time since bots execution
is blocking: if a bot takes a long time to decide what to do, it will block all the others. Second,
since there is no separation between the bots and the simulation engine, the bots have full access
to all the data structures deﬁning the track and the current status of the race. As a consequence,
each bot can use diﬀerent information for its driving strategy. Furthermore, bots can analyze
the complete state of the race (e.g., the track structure, the opponents position, speed, etc.) to
plan their actions. Accordingly, a fair comparison among methods of computational intelligence
is diﬃcult since diﬀerent methods might access diﬀerent information. Last but not least, TORCS
restricts the choice of the programming language to C/C++ since the bots must be compiled as
loadable module of the main TORCS application which is written in C++.

The competition software extends the original TORCS architecture in three respects. First, it
structures TORCS as a client-server applications: the bots are run as external processes connected
to the race server through UDP connections. Second, it adds real-time: every game tic (roughly

corresponding to 20ms of simulated time), the server sends the current sensory inputs to each bot
and then it waits for 10ms (of real time) to receive an action from the bot. If no action arrives,
the simulation continues and the last performed action is used. Finally, the competition software
creates a physical separation between the driver code and the race server building an abstraction
layer, a sensors and actuators model, which (i) gives complete freedom of choice regarding the
programming language used for bots and (ii) restricts the access only to the information deﬁned
by the designer.

The architecture of the competition software is shown in Figure 1. The game engine is the
same as the original TORCS, the main modiﬁcation in a new server-bot, called scr server, which
manages the connection between the game and a client bot using UDP. A race involves one server-
bot for each client; each server-bot listens on a separate port of the race server. At the beginning,
each client-bot identiﬁes itself to a corresponding server-bot establishing a connection. Then, as
the race starts, each server-bot sends the current sensory information to its client and awaits for an
action until 10ms (of real time) have passed. Every game tic, corresponding to 20ms of simulated
time, the server updates the state of the race which is sent back to the clients. A client can request
a race restart by sending a special action to the server.

Installing the Competition Server

To provide a very accessible interface to TORCS we developed two modules to run TORCS in a
client/server architecture. The server has been developed by providing a speciﬁc bot driver called
scr server that, instead of having its own intelligence, sends the game state to a client module
and waits for a reply, i.e., an action to be performed by the controller. So to begin the competition,
we ﬁrst need to install TORCS and the competition server-package provided in this bundle.

3.1 Linux Version

Download the all-in-one TORCS 1.3.4 source package from SourceForge (http://sourceforge.
net/projects/torcs/) or directly from here. To compile the server you will need:

• Hardware accelerated OpenGL (usually provided by your Linux distribution)

3

TORCSBOTServerGame Engine...BOTServerClientControllerClientControllerSensors & Actuators Model• GLUT 3.7 or FreeGlut (better than GLUT for full screen support)

• PLIB 1.8.5 version

• OpenAL

• libpng and zlib (usually provided by your Linux distribution)

• FreeALUT

Unpack the package torcs-1.3.4.tar.bz2, with “tar xfvj torcs-1.3.4.tar.bz2” which

will create the directory torcs-1.3.4.

Download the package scr-linux-patch.tgz containing the patch for the TORCS sources
from the CIG project page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/cig/ or as a direct download
from here. Unpack the package scr-linux-patch.tgz in your base TORCS directory (where you
unpacked torcs-1.3.4.tar.bz2). This will create a new directory called scr-patch. Enter the
scr-patch directory and run the script do patch.sh with “sh do patch.sh” (run do unpatch.sh
to revert the modiﬁcations). Move to the parent directory (where you unpacked torcs-1.3.4.tar.bz2)
and run

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
$ make datainstall

At this point you should be able to check whether the competition software has been properly
installed by executing the command “torcs”; then, from the main window select

Race → Quick Race → Conﬁgure Race → Accept.

If everything has been installed correctly, you should ﬁnd ten instances of the scr server bot in
the list of “Not Selected Player” on the righthand side.

Further information about the installation process are available here. Additional information are
available at http://www.berniw.org/ (TORCS → Installation – from left bar).

3.2 Windows Version

It is possible to compile TORCS on Windows from sources but it can be rather challenging. There-
fore, we provide the binary distribution of the competition software for Windows. In this case, to
install the competition software ﬁrst download the TORCS 1.3.4 Windows installer from https://
sourceforge.net/projects/torcs/files/torcs-win32-bin/ and install it. Then, download the
ﬁle scr-win-patch.zip from the CIG project page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/cig/
or as a direct download from here. Unzip the package in the TORCS main directory. During the
unpacking, you will be asked to overwrite some existing ﬁles, answer yes for all the ﬁles. At this
point you should be able to check whether the competition software has been properly installed
by launching wtorcs.exe from the installation directory or from the start menu; then, from the
TORCS main window select,

Race → Quick Race → Conﬁgure Race → Accept.

If everything has been installed correctly, you should ﬁnd ten instances of the scr server bot in
the list of “Not Selected Player” on the righthand side.

3.3 Mac OsX

We do not provide support for Mac OsX since it is not supported by the TORCS developers.

4 The C++ Client

The C++ client for the competition is a stand-alone console applications that can be compiled from
the sources. The package can be downloaded from the CIG project page at http://sourceforge.
net/projects/cig/ or as a direct download from here.

4.1 Compiling for Linux

Unpack the client package scr-client-cpp.tgz creating the directory scr-client-cpp. Then,
open a terminal in the directory where you unpacked the client and type make to compile it.
The compilation process should end without any error or warning and you should now have an
executable named client in you directory. To launch the client, type,

$ ./client host:<ip> port:<p> id:<client-id> maxEpisodes:<me> \

maxSteps:<ms> track:<trackname> stage:<s>

where <ip> is the IP address of the machine where the TORCS competition server is running
(the default is localhost); <p> is the port on which the server-bot is listening, typical values are
between 3001 and 3010 (the default is 3001); <client-id> is your bot ID (the default is SCR);
<me> is the maximum number of learning episodes to perform (the default value is 1); <ms> is the
maximum number of control steps in each episode. (the default value is 0, i.e., unlimited number
of steps); <trackname> is the name1 of the track where the bot will race (default value is unknown);
<s> is an integer that represents the current stage of the competition the bot is involved in: 0 is
Warm-up, 1 is Qualifying, 2 is Race, and 3 is Unknown (default is Unknown). All the parameters
are optional (if not speciﬁed, the default values are used instead).

4.2 Compiling for Windows

Unpack the client package scr-client-cpp.tgz creating the directory scr-client-cpp. The
package is provided with a DevC++ project ﬁle (http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html) but
any C++ development tool/IDE may be used. To compile the client on Windows, uncomment
the ﬁrst two lines of client.cpp following the instructions provided in the same ﬁle. The package
also contains the system library WS2_32.lib that is required for using the WinSock functions. The
client should compile without any error or warning, producing the client.exe executable. To
launch the client open an MS-DOS console and type:

client.exe host:<ip> port:<p> id:<client-id> maxEpisodes:<me> \

maxSteps:<ms> track:<trackname> stage:<s>

where <ip> is the IP address of the machine where the TORCS competition server is running
(the default is localhost); <p> is the port on which the server-bot is listening, typical values are
between 3001 and 3010 (the default is 3001); <client-id> is your bot ID (the default is SCR);

1This trackname is not necessarily the name of the track in TORCS. It is a conventional name that can be used

by the bot to store its own information speciﬁc for the diﬀerent tracks.

5

<me> is the maximum number of learning episodes to perform (the default value is 1); <ms> is the
maximum number of control steps in each episode. (the default value is 0, i.e., unlimited number
of steps); <trackname> is the name2 of the track where the bot will race (default value is unknown);
<s> is an integer that represents the current stage of the competition the bot is involved in: 0 is
Warm-up, 1 is Qualifying, 2 is Race, and 3 is Unknown (default is Unknown). All the parameters
are optional (if not speciﬁed, the default values are used instead).

4.3 Customizing Your Own Driver

To write your own driver, the BaseDriver class provided in the client sources must be extended
and these methods must be implemented:

• void init(float *angles), the method is called before the beginning of the race and can
be used to deﬁne a custom conﬁguration of the track sensors (see Table 2): the desired angles
(w.r.t. the car axis) of all the 19 range ﬁnder sensors must be set in the parameter angles.

• string drive(string sensors), where sensors represents the current state of the game
as perceived by your driver; the method returns a string representing the actions taken (see
Section 6 for details regarding sensors and actuators);

• void onShutdown(), the method called at the end of the race, before the driver module is

unloaded;

• void onRestart(), the method called when the race is restarted upon the driver request
(this function should be used to free allocated memory, close open ﬁles, saving to disk, etc.).

In addition, the class attributes stage and trackName contain respectively the current stage of
the race (warm-up, qualifying, race or unknown) and the name of the current track (both the
stage and the track name must be speciﬁed using the corresponding command line option of the
client). This information can be used to save useful information about the current track as well
as to adopt diﬀerent strategies in the diﬀerent stages of the competition. As an example, the ﬁle
SimpleDriver.cpp implements a very simple driver and it is used by default to build the client
executable. Therefore, to build a client executable to run your own driver:

• on Windows, uncomment the ﬁrst two lines of client.cpp and set the __DRIVER_CLASS__
and __DRIVER_INCLUDE__ deﬁnitions to the name of the implemented driver class and to the
header ﬁle of the same driver class.

• on Linux, in the Makefile set DRIVER_CLASS and DRIVER_INCLUDE to the name of the

implemented driver class and to the header ﬁle of the same driver class.

5 The Java Client

The Java client works similarly to the C++ version. It is a stand-alone console application that
can be compiled from the sources. The package can be downloaded from the CIG project page at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cig/ or as a direct download from here.

2This trackname is not necessarily the name of the track in TORCS. It is a conventional name that can be used

by the bot to store its own information speciﬁc for the diﬀerent tracks.

5.1 Running the Java Client

First, unpack the package scr-client-java.tgz to create the directory scr-client-java con-
taining the source code. To compile the client, go to the directory src and type,

$ javac -d ../classes scr/*.java

To launch the Java client with a simple controller, go to the directory classes and type,

$ java scr.Client scr.SimpleDriver host:<ip> port:<p> id:<client-id> \

maxEpisodes:<me> maxSteps:<ms> verbose:<v> track:<trackname> stage:<s>

where scr.SimpleDriver is the implementation of a controller provided with the software as an
example (it can be replaced with a custom implementation); where <ip> is the IP address of the
machine where the TORCS competition server is running (the default is localhost); <p> is the
port on which the server-bot is listening, typical values are between 3001 and 3010 (the default is
3001); <client-id> is your bot ID (the default is SCR); <me> is the maximum number of learning
episodes to perform (the default value is 1); <ms> is the maximum number of control steps in each
episode. (the default value is 0, i.e., unlimited number of steps); <v> controls the verbosity level,
it can be either on or off (the default value is off); <trackname> is the name3 of the track where
the bot will race (default value is unknown); <s> is an integer that represents the current stage of
the competition the bot is involved in: 0 is Warm-up, 1 is Qualifying, 2 is Race, and 3 is Unknown
(default is Unknown). All the parameters are optional (if not speciﬁed, the default values are used
instead).

5.2 Customizing Your Own Driver

The Java client is organized similarly to the C++ client. To write your own driver, the Controller
interface must be implemented by providing the following methods:

• public float[] initAngles(). the method is called before the beginning of the race and
can be used to deﬁne a custom conﬁguration of the track sensors (see Table 2): the method
returns a vector of the 19 desired angles (w.r.t. the car axis) for each one of the 19 range
ﬁnders.

• public Action control(SensorModel sensors), where sensors represents the current state
of the game as perceived by your driver; the method returns the action taken (see Section 6);

• public void shutdown(), the method called at the end of the race, before the driver module

is unloaded;

• public void reset(), the method called when the race is restarted upon the driver request
(this function should be used to free allocated memory, close open ﬁles, saving to disk, etc.).

In addition, the class attributes stage and trackName contains respectively the current stage of
the race (warm-up, qualifying, race or unknown) and the name of the current track (both the
stage and the track name must be speciﬁed using the corresponding command line option of the
client). This information can be used to save useful information about the current track as well
as to adopt diﬀerent strategies in the diﬀerent stages of the competition. As an example, the ﬁle
SimpleDriver.java implements a very simple driver.

3This trackname is not necessarily the name of the track in TORCS. It is a conventional name that can be used

by the bot to store its own information speciﬁc for the diﬀerent tracks.

7

6 Sensors and Actuators

The competition software creates a physical separation between the game engine and the drivers.
Thus, to develop a bot it is not required any knowledge about the TORCS engine or the internal data
structure. The drivers perceptions and the available actions are deﬁned by a sensors and actuators
layer deﬁned by the competition designer. For this competition, the drivers inputs consists of some
data about the car status (the current gear, the fuel level, etc.) the race status (the current lap,
the distance raced, etc.) and the car surroundings (the track borders, the obstacles, etc.). The
actions allow the typical driving actions.

6.1 Sensors

The bot perceives the racing environment through a number of sensor readings which provide
information both about the surrounding game environment (e.g., the tracks, the opponents, the
speed, etc.) and the current state of the race (e.g., the current lap time and the position in the race,
etc.). Table 1 and Table 2 report the complete list of sensors available along with a description.
Please notice that the readings provided by opponents sensors (Table 1) do not take into account
the edges of the track, i.e., distances between cars are computed “as the crow ﬂies” even if the
paths cross the edges of the track.

6.2 Actuators

The bot controls the car in the game through a rather typical set of actuators, i.e., the steering
wheel, the gas pedal, the brake pedal, and the gearbox. In addition, a meta-action is available to
request a race restart to the server. Table 3 details the actions available and their representation.

7 Running the Competition Server

Once you have installed TORCS and the server-bot provided (either Windows or Linux version),
you can start to develop your own bot extending one of the provided client modules. When you
want to run your own bot you have to launch TORCS and start a race, then you have to launch
the client extended with your own programmed bot and ﬁnally your driver bot will start to run
in the race. In TORCS there are several race modes available, however the client-server modules
supports only two modes:

• the Practice mode that allows a single bot at once to race

• the Quick Race modes that allows multiple bots to race against

However, before starting a race with TORCS, you need to conﬁgure the following things:

• you have to select the track on which you want to run the race

• you need to add a scr_server x bot to race participants and eventually other bots you want

as opponents

• you have to deﬁne how many laps or how many kilometers that race will last

• you might want to select the desired display mode

8

In TORCS, all the above options are stored in a set of XML conﬁguration ﬁles (one for each race
mode). Under Linux conﬁguration ﬁles are created after the game is launched for the ﬁrst time
and are located in $HOME/.torcs/config/raceman/, where $HOME is your home directory. Under
Windows instead the conﬁguration ﬁles are located in the \config\raceman\ directory located
under the directory where you installed TORCS.

7.1 Conﬁguring TORCS Race Via GUI

The easiest way to conﬁgure the race options is using the TORCS GUI. Each race mode can be
fully conﬁgured selecting from the main menu of TORCS:

Race → Quick Race [or Practice] → Conﬁgure Race.

Once you change the conﬁgurations of a particular race mode, all the changes are stored automat-
ically by TORCS the corresponding conﬁguration ﬁle.

Selecting track.
then click on Accept to move to the next screen.

In the ﬁrst screen you can select any of the track available in the games and

Selecting bots. The second screen allows the selections of bot that will participate to the race.
Notice that in the Practice mode only one bot is allowed, therefore in order to add a bot you have
ﬁrst to deselect the currently selected one (if any). First of all you have to make sure that one
competition bot, scr server x, is in the list of selected drivers (on the left of the screen). Then,
in the Quick Race mode only, you can add other drivers to the race from the list on the right
(representing all the bot drivers provided with the game). When adding bots pay attention to the
car model they use: there are several types of car in TORCS with diﬀerent features and you might
want to be sure that only drivers with the same cars will race against. Notice that scr server
uses a car1-trb1 and the others bot using the same car are:

• tita 3

• berniw 3

• olethros 3

• lliaw 3

• inferno 3

• bt 3

When you have selected all the drivers that will be in the race, you can click on Accept and move
to the next screen

In the ﬁnal conﬁguration screen you can set the race
Setting race length and display mode.
length either as the distance to cover (in km) or as the number of laps to complete. Finally you
can choose between two display modes option: normal or results only. The normal mode allows
you to see the race either from the point of view of one bot driver or as an external spectator. In
this display mode, the time speed can be accelerated up to four times the normal speed, that is you
can see 1 minute of race in 15s. In the results only mode instead you will not see the race but only
the lap times (in Practice mode) or the ﬁnal result of the race (in Quick Race mode). However this
mode allow you to run simulation much faster: time speed can be accelerated up to 20 times (or
even more), that is one minute of race can be simulated within 3 seconds.

7.2 Conﬁguring TORCS through Conﬁguration Files

All the race settings described above can be conﬁgured also editing directly a conﬁguration ﬁle. In
TORCS each race type as its own XML conﬁguration ﬁle. The settings of Practice are stored in
practice.xml while the settings of Quick Race are in quickrace.xml.

Selecting track. To select the track, ﬁnd the “Tracks” section inside the XML ﬁle, that will
contain the following section:

<section name="1">

<attstr name="name" val="TRACK-NAME"/>
<attstr name="category" val="TRACK-CAT"/>

</section>

where you should (i) replace TRACK-ROAD with the category of desired track (i.e., road,oval or dirt);
(ii) replace TRACK-NAME with the name of desired track (e.g., aalborg). For a complete list of the
installed tracks in TORCS, you can see the list of all the directories organized under three main
directories, tracks/road/,tracks/oval/ and tracks/dirt/, where TORCS is installed. Under
Windows you ﬁnd them in your main torcs directory, under Linux the tracks directories could be
found in /usr/local/share/games/torcs/ or in diﬀerent places depending on your distribution.

Selecting bots. To select bots you should modify the “Drivers” section inside the XML ﬁle. In
particular in this section you should be able to ﬁnd a list of the following elements:

<section name="N">

<attnum name="idx" val="IDX"/>
<attstr name="module" val="NAME"/>

</section>

where N means you are editing the N th bots that will be in the race. The IDX is the index of
the instance of the bot you want to add: for some bots provided with the game there are several
instances (e.g., bt bot has several instances: bt 1, bt 2, · · ·); when a bot has only one instance IDX
should be set to 1). The NAME should be replaced with the name of bot you want to add without
the index of the instance (e.g., to add the bt 7 bot, you should use as NAME simply bt and 7 as
IDX). A list of available drivers can be found in the drivers/ directory located in the same place
where you have the tracks directory introduced before.

10

Setting race length and display mode. To change race length and display mode you have to
modify the “Quick Race” or “Practice” section (depending on which race type you want to setup).
In particular you should change the following lines:

...
<attnum name="distance" unit="km" val="DIST"/>
...
<attnum name="laps" val="LAPS"/>
...
<attstr name="display mode" val="MODE"/>
...

where DIST should be either the desired race length in km or 0 if the number of laps is used as race
length. Accordingly, LAPS should be either the desired number of laps or 0 if the distance is used
as race length. Finally MODE is either normal or results only.

7.3 Start to Race!

Once you conﬁgured properly TORCS you are ready to run your own bot. From the main menu
of TORCS select:

Race → Quick Race [or Practice] → New Race.

You should see that TORCS screen should stop reporting the line

Initializing Driver scr_server 1...

The OS terminal should report Waiting for request on port 3001. This means that the server-
bot scr server is waiting for your client to start the race. After the race is started, it can be
interrupted from the user by pressing ESC and then by selecting Abort Race from the menu. The
end of the race is notiﬁed to the client either if it has been interrupted by a user or if the distance/lap
limit of the race has been reached. Please notice that it the Quit Game option is chosen in the
game menu, instead of the Abort Race option, the end of the race will not be notiﬁed correctly to
the clients preventing them from performing a clean shutdown.

7.4 Running TORCS in text-mode

It is possible to run TORCS without graphics, i.e. without any GUI to launch the race. This run
mode could be useful when you plan to run an experiment (or a series of experiments) in a batch
mode and you do not need to use the GUI to setup the experiment. Using the “-r” command line
option it is possible to specify the race conﬁguration ﬁle an to run TORCS in text-mode, as follows:

C:\> wtorcs.exe -r race_config.xml (on Windows)
$ torcs -r race_config.xml (on linux)

TORCS will run automatically the race deﬁned by the race_config.xml ﬁle, that can be conﬁgured
either using the GUI or directly editing it (as explained in the previous section).

11

7.5 Disabling Fuel, Damage and Laptime Limit

To performs very long experiments in TORCS it is necessary to disable some features that can stop
or alter the simulation. Fuel consumption and damage should be disabled for two reasons: ﬁrst,
they increase the noise in the evaluation process because two individuals with a diﬀerent amount
of fuel or damage have diﬀerent performance; second if the fuel is low or the damage too high the
car is removed from the race. The laptime limit removes a car from a race if it takes to much to
complete a lap. This situation can happen if with a particular conﬁguration of parameters the car
performances are very poor.

To disable these features it is possible to run the patched version of TORCS with these command

line arguments:

C:\> wtorcs.exe -nofuel -nodamage -nolaptime (on Windows)
$ torcs -nofuel -nodamage -nolaptime (on Linux)

Of course each of this arguments can be used alone or in combination with the others.

7.6 Time Constraints

In the development of your driver, please keep in mind that the race is in real-time. Accordingly,
the server has a timeout on the client answers: your driver should perform an action (i.e., return
an action string) by 10ms in order to keep in sync with the server. If your bot is slower, you would
probably loose the sync with the server and so it is up to you to ﬁnd out how to avoid that this
will happen. It is also possible to specify a custom timeout through the following command line
option:

C:\> wtorcs.exe -t <timeout> (on Windows)
$ torcs -t <timeout> (on Linux)

where timeout is the desired timeout (measured as nanoseconds).

7.7 Noisy sensors

By default, the range ﬁnders in the sensor model are not noisy. However, during the competition
noisy range ﬁnders will be used (according to the speciﬁcation in Table 1 and Table 2). To enable
noisy range ﬁnders, it is possible to use the following command line option:

C:\> wtorcs.exe -noisy (on Windows)
$ torcs -noisy (on Linux)

Vector of 5 range ﬁnder sensors: each sensor returns the dis-
tance between the track edge and the car within a range of
200 meters. When noisy option is enabled (see Section 7)
sensors are aﬀected by i.i.d. normal noises with a standard
deviation equal to the 1% of sensors range. The sensors
sample, with a resolution of one degree, a ﬁve degree space
along a speciﬁc direction provided by the client (the direc-
tion is deﬁned with the focus command and must be in the
range [-90,+90] degrees w.r.t. the car axis). Focus sensors
are not always available: they can be used only once per sec-
ond of simulated time. When the car is outside of the track
(i.e., pos is less than -1 or greater than 1), the focus direc-
tion is outside the allowed range ([-90,+90] degrees) or the
sensors has been already used once in the last second, the
returned values are not reliable (typically -1 is returned).

Current fuel level.
Current gear: -1 is reverse, 0 is neutral and the gear from

Vector of 36 opponent sensors: each sensor covers a span
of 10 degrees within a range of 200 meters and returns the
distance of the closest opponent in the covered area. When
noisy option is enabled (see Section 7), sensors are aﬀected
by i.i.d. normal noises with a standard deviation equal to
the 2% of sensors range. The 36 sensors cover all the space
around the car, spanning clockwise from -180 degrees up to
+180 degrees with respect to the car axis.

Vector of 19 range ﬁnder sensors: each sensors returns the
distance between the track edge and the car within a range
of 200 meters. When noisy option is enabled (see Sec-
tion 7), sensors are aﬀected by i.i.d. normal noises with a
standard deviation equal to the 10% of sensors range. By
default, the sensors sample the space in front of the car ev-
ery 10 degrees, spanning clockwise from -90 degrees up to
+90 degrees with respect to the car axis. However, the con-
ﬁguration of the range ﬁnder sensors (i.e., the angle w.r.t.
to the car axis) can be set by the client once during initial-
ization, i.e., before the beginning of each race. When the
car is outside of the track (i.e., pos is less than -1 or greater
than 1), the returned values are not reliable (typically -1 is
returned).

Distance between the car and the track axis. The value is
normalized w.r.t to the track width: it is 0 when car is on
the axis, -1 when the car is on the right edge of the track
and +1 when it is on the left edge of the car. Values greater
than 1 or smaller than -1 mean that the car is outside of
the track.
Vector of 4 sensors representing the rotation speed of
wheels.
